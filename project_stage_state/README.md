This module restores the `state` fields to Project Stages, removed in Odoo 8.0.

For some use cases it‘s necessary to be able to map the multiple Stages into 
a few broad groups.

For example, this can allow to define automated actions and business logic for 
Tasks not yet “Started”, knowing that “Started” means different Stages in 
different Projects.

Additionally adds a “Folded in Statusbar” flag to Stages, giving control on
the stages visible on Tasks and Issues Stage statusbar.

Also adds to Sates an information of the Projects it is used on.
